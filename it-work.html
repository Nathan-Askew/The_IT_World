						<h1>IT Work </h1>
<h2>Interview with Marcus Wong</h2>


<h4>  1.       Please tell us what started your passion in IT and why did you choose a career in this industry?<br></h4>
  I was interested in electronics early on. But I didn't get really interested in computers until my family got our first computer when I was in high school. Mostly just for playing games at the start.<br>
<br>
  It had FrontPage Express installed on it, so I tried my hand at making my own web page, this was back in the early 2000s. We didn't have internet connection, so I had to transfer the website files to the library computer, where I could upload them to a free web host.<br>
<br>
  Only real programming I did was small programs in TI-BASIC on my TI-83 graphics calculator.<br>
<br>
  But I also liked tinkering around with installing things and broke it a few times, after having to pay someone to fix it the first few times, I had to work out to fix it myself. Managed to get my hands onto some older computers as well, started taking them apart and reassembling, making them work again.<br>
<br>
  By late high school I was doing computer networking and electronics subjects. For further study I considered electronics, IT, telecommunications and computer networking courses.<br>
<br>
  I hadn't done much programming before I started uni, but I really enjoyed my first subject. Starting doing more programming after that in my own time, building websites in PHP.<br>
<br>
<h4>  2.       What qualifications do you have?</h4>
<br>
  Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) and Bachelor of Engineering (Telecommunications and Internet Technologies) double degree at Swinburne<br>
<br>
<h4>  3.       Please tell us about your IT work.  What exactly do you do?</h4>
<br>
  Software developer at PageUp People, the company provides HR software to large companies to recruit, train and manage the performance of their staff.<br>
  In the 10 years I've been there I've been in a number of different teams, always on the IT side.<br>
<br>
  Mix of:<br>
  - adding new features to the system based on client requests or market opportunities<br>
  - resolving support cases reported by clients or internal users<br>
  - applying fixes and patches to the product to keep the system secure<br>
  - reworking existing code to cater for increased usage / higher performance<br>
<br>
<h4>  4.       Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>

  PageUp People is a Software as a Service (SaaS) company - we host the software product on servers that we manage, clients pay an initial implementation fee plus annual service fee to continue using it.<br>
<br>
<h4>  5.       What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h4>

  - assisting other software developers with their work. eg: assisting them with understanding of existing code, reviewing their code changes before they are released, suggesting ways that they can solve the taks that they are working on<br>
  - answering questions from customer facing staff about how the system works, by reading the existing code<br>
  - documenting how system works, so that other developers or customer facing staff can understand how the system works<br>
<br>
  <h4>6.       What skills do you think are highly regarded in your industry?</h4>

  - listening, people and problem solving skills. Non-IT people come to you with what they see as the problem, and sometimes what they think the solution could be. But you need to look deeper to see the actual task they are trying to solve, as there might be a different way to solve it. Sometimes the suggested solution was created because they thought there were constraints limiting their options, but those constraints might not actually exist.<br>
  <br>

<h4>  7.       Who are the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h4>

  - 1st level support team taking phone calls and emails from clients having issues with the system. I help them by explaining how system is supposed to work, and put together bugfixes if the system is not behaving as expected<br>
  - account managers have regular contacts with our client, helping them to use the system. They often need answers to questions about how the system works<br>
  - product owners are responsible for a specific part of the software product, they prioritise what work developers do based on the value it would give the end user, as well as projhect management<br>
<br>
  <h4>8.       Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h4>

  - security team, they look at security adversaries and reported issues, and assess the risk, looking at the probability and impact if it happened, and prioritise fixes<br>
  - database administrator, they produce input in the way we query the database, as well as flagging issues in the system that requires input from a software developer<br>
  - desktop IT support keep our computers and phones running, ensure office network and servers are online<br>
  - user experience designers, they come up with designs for how screens in the software should look. Developers also go to them with questions about user interaction when building new functionality.<br>
  - user experience researchers spend time interviewing users to see how they interact with the software, and the problems they are using the software to solve<br>
  - software developers at other software companies, our product is integrated with other software products via APIs, some back and forth needed to make it work<br>
  - IT staff at client's companies, sometimes we need to debug issues with file transfer between our servers and theirs, or network connectivity issues<br>
<br>
<h4>  9.       What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h4>

  - contact with clients with support cases usually at arms length via 1st level support team<br>
<br>
<h4>  10.   What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h4>

  Probably reading existing code and understanding what it does, either to explain how it works to non-technical people, to fix a bug, to add new functionality to the existing system, or help other developers with a problem they are solving<br>
<br>
<h4>  11.   Which aspect of your work do you find most challenging?</h4>

  Realising that you've become roadblocked on a problem and no longer making any progress on it. Often can spend an entire day trying to get somewhere, and not get anywhere. But often taking a step back to explain it to a colleague is enough to come up with a new lead to follow.<br>
<br>
<h4>  12.   Finally can you share an example of the work you do that best describes the essence of the IT industry</h4>

  Customer facing support team member asked for help for one of their clients - configuring system was a two step process, where data was input on one page, then processed on another. I looked into the problem deeper, and found that there was no reason for the processing needed to be a single step - was able to bundle it up with data entry part of the system, removing the opportunity for the step to be forgotten, and saving their time.<br>

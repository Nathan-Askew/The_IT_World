											<h3>Introduction</h3>
											<p>	Our project is to develop a website that will enable users to find a wide variety of charity works, 
												conservation efforts, community projects or other crowd funded projects across Australia. 
												These charities and projects will be displayed on our site after they have been identified 
												as an honest and impactful charity through an analysis conducted by our team. By doing this, 
												people can open our site, browse across a country map, view a wide variety of charity works, 
												knowing that all these charities are going to put their donations to good use and be used for 
												the purpose that they have detailed.

	<h3>Motivation : </h3>
<p>This application will be useful as there are many people that help in a charitable way but want to know that their money is going to the right place and will help those that really need the assistance. There is also currently a huge amount of distrust with charities across Australia. This is partially due to several large charities taking in millions of dollars of donations for the 2019/2020 summer bushfires relief and large portions of these donations were not being sent to though that needed immediate help. In fact, the Australian Red-cross director Noel Clements admitted that of the $115million donated by Australians and internationally at least $11million would be used for ‘administration costs’, and in May the red cross had only distributed  40% of the money they had received with the Salvation Army having only passed on  $19 million of the $41 million raised. This is one of the reasons that this website will help. It will give donors an accurate indication of where their money is really going. Although there are similar websites already established what we aim to provide a more user-friendly approach whereby we can present the information to users in an easy to absorb manner. We think that if people want to donate their hard-earned money it should be easy for them to find and process what they need to make an informed choice. </p>

											<h4>Tools:</h4>
											<p>	
												<b>1.	GitHub/Visual Studio,</b>
													We will be using GitHub or Visual Studio as these applications are compatible for team projects and what we are most familiar with.
													Moreover, these apps provide free local hosting service for working and updating the web while in the developing process. 
													<br>
												<b>2.	Text Editor (Notepad ++, Atom.io, etc) </b>
													This tool is very essential in the making of this project because editor is like the control panel of our website. 
													The code, page layout and functions are everything set in the text editor. In other words, without this tool we can’t edit the appearance and how our website works.
													<br>	
												<b>3.	Open Source Template</b>
													We are planning to use template for our website instead of creating it from scratch.
													However, it is way easier to use templates because we already got the design and it is only matter of changing the text inside it. 
													<b>(html5up.com/templated.co)</b>
													<br>
												<b>4.	Bootstrap </b>
													Bootstrap is to provide functions in our website. 
													In order to make our website more interactive and arranged this tool is very essential. 
													By collaborating it with the text editor, we will get maximum function of this tool called Bootstrap.
													<b>(bootstrap4.com)</b>
											</p>

											<h4>Technologies:</h4>
											<p>
												<b>1.	Website Hosting Service</b>
													After all is done and we are sure that the website is adequately developed, the next step is to think about using a Web Hosting Service. 
													A service that allows us to release the website we made to public so that everybody all around the world can see and surf in our web. 
													There are 3 leading hosting companies which are Blue Host, HostGator and, Hostinger.com. 
													<br>
												<b>2.	Clouds (GitHub)</b>
													The Cloud technology held a huge role in this web making since we are using GitHub for our project. 
													Pushing and Pulling works to the GitHub repository in GitHub app is one example of the Cloud technology.

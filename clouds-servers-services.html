										<h2>Clouds, Servers and Services</h2>
										<p>by Geoffrey Timothy.</p>

									<h3>Clouds</h3>
									<p>	<b>Clouds</b> is basically an invisible storage that stores your data on the internet. 
										This cloud technology is not really a new technology it was invented in the 1960s by Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider in his project with ARPANET. 
										Connecting people and data at any place and time was his vision back then.
										Cloud computing has a benefit which is its ease in  maintenance which is for me will be the greatest state of art of the technology because people don’t have to worry about their data age since it always comes with new updates every time to make it performs gradually better. 
										One thing that can be done now by using this Cloud technology is simply and solely its main function that is to store data virtually on the internet. 
										The innovation of the technology will keep on developing and could be someone’s main income in 3 to 5 years time later as Cloud computing has gained lots amount of money even today. 
										This could be seen as hosting companies are undergoing massive growth in revenue because of huge demand in the market for clouds. 
										The physical storage which is servers are taken care by hosting companies. 
										There are two big companies that dominate the Cloud sector and they are Amazon and Google.
										<br>
										<b>The most visible impact today</b> is people do not have to spend much money on hard disks and upgrading their internal storage because everything can be stored in the cloud. 
										The only thing they need to do is spending certain amount of money on certain amount of storage that hosting companies offered. 
										Almost all people that use electronic devices will be affected by this technology since if they are creating an email, for instance, a Gmail, they will get free 15 GB space in Google Drive, and it is usable. 
										The most possible technology that will be affected by this is the old-fashioned hard disks and also beside that the paper technology will also be affected. 
										A person’s job such as secretary will also slowly replaced by Cloud since the CEOs are able to store their data and needs virtually.
										<br>
										<b>For myself,</b> Clouds hasn’t had an important role yet in my life. 
										It is because I still mainly use my internal storage to store all of my data which is not really good actually because when someday my system corrupts, I won’t be able to retrieve and recover my data. 
										I guess I should start using the Cloud technology more often. 
										I use Cloud when it comes to assignments when I need to do a teamwork with some friends. 
										Cloud helps us to work efficiently because we can work and progress at the same time and save it on the internet. 
										Therefore, the work needed can be done in a little amount of time.
									</p>

									<h4>Servers</h4>
									<p>	<b>What are Servers?</b> 
										They are basically computing hardware or software but has lots of function.
										Servers support programs or devices have their functionality to run smoothly.
										The state of art of this technology is actually when it is connected to other programs or devices because it is designed to be connected to something.
										These programs or devices are better known as clients. Clients have requests to the servers and servers respond with actions.
										That is how servers work today in simple explanation, more like a request-response function.
										The most common use of servers is as a Data Center where big companies store most of their information.
										“Servers are going to be different in the future than they are today,” said Joe Kava, the Senior Director of Data Centers for Google.
										In 5 years time, the look of servers might be entirely different, “I think there’s a lot of people interested in direct liquid cooling,” said Zahl Limbuwala, CEO of Romonet and head of the British Data Centre Specialist Group.
										There might be a chance that servers will have direct liquid cooling in the future.
										All that a server needs is a running program or a client to make it works properly.
										<br>
										<b>What are the impacts that servers made? </b>
										We can’t resist the fact that the world is changing, and technology is the king today. 
										Whenever there are servers and programs, they will create a modern market. 
										This condition will create a huge challenge to people who still stick with traditional way of trading. 
										For example, Amazon, eBay and other online marketplaces shift the way people buy and sell things. 
										Moreover, conventional stores or physical stores should take some actions regarding to this otherwise they will be left out with technology.
										<br>
										<b>To be honest,</b>
										I never been into a data center before in my whole life and I never clearly see what a server is actually look like.
										However, my family as well as me also can feel the impact of servers through the way we buy things today. 
										We no longer go to stores and search for things, it is simply to open our phone at the moment especially in this pandemic time. 
									</p>
									
									<h5>Services</h5>
									<p>	<b>What are Services?</b>
										This might be more like a term or definition for some people. 
										Services are actually the process that connects Servers and Clouds. 
										Frankly, without any hosting companies there will not be a such thing called cloud storage system.
										Hosting companies’ role here is to provide services for their users. They take care of the servers which are connected to the cloud.
										In other words, services are actually the effort behind the technologies offered in the front end – the back end of technologies.
										At the moment, Google is developing a new technology to their search engine where people might experience other extra functions when they are about to make actions.
										For instance, people will be able to make hotel reservations without even going to the hotel website. This function maybe applicable in the near future.  
										<br>
										<b>Let’s talk about Google Search Engine – referring to Application Server,</b>
										this is one of services that Google offered which I believe most of the human race rely on every day.  
										A huge impact could clearly visible with the presence of Google Search Engine as we can see most of students nowadays use internet to search information instead of searching them in books.
										I could say that people all over the world is affected by the technology since it is already revolutionary. 
										One of the effects regarding to this technology is a decrease interest in reading among teenagers, especially millennials. 
										Sales of books may also drop following the prior effect stated. 
										<br>
										<b>The fact that the technology has affected most people including Me.</b>
										I use Google as a part of my life, for example, when I’m lost with directions to some place, I will definitely open the Google Maps app and make my way to that place.
										In this case the difference is, I don’t have to bring that wide physical map and guessing where I am right now.
										I just simply open my phone and display my exact location. 
										I also believe that most of my friends and families might use this service Google offered when they are lost with directions.

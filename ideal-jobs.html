<h3>3.Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>

<p>
<ul>

<li><strong> Dillon:</strong>
   My opinion on my ideal job has not changed after looked at the burning glass data as there are plenty of job postings for the job, which means competition but high frequency so ascertaining a my job should be easy enough to apply for many and at least land one that is idea for me and my skill set.
</li>
<li><strong> Nathan:</strong>

My opinion of my ideal job has not changed after reviewing this data, if anything my opinion has greatened as I have seen just how much demand there is for people in this field. This will hopefully mean that when I graduate at the end of this year, I will be able to move into a role that can either lead to my ideal job or a job that has similar task as my ideal job. This way I can start gaining experience so that one day I can move into my ideal job with confidence that I have the skills necessary to perform it well.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Thomas:  </strong>

My ideal job was Research fellow in machine learning for cyber security.

My opinion of my ideal job has changed.  With skills in the greatest demand, communication skills are by far the most required, by a long shot.  I always thought of an IT job as a nerdy code monkey.  Someone who huddled in front of a computer and, gets “in the zone” and codes all day.  According to burning glass this stereotype is wrong.  Anyone in the IT industry must have highly polished communication skills.  Professionals must have the ability to communicate with clients, colleagues managers and other team members.  Problem solving skills, organisational, writing and teamwork skills are pretty self-evident.  It is pretty obvious that an IT professional would require these skills.

Skills in the greatest demand are: SQL, JavaScript, Java MS Window, project management and SAP

The requirements for research fellow in machine learning for cyber security are- deep representation learning and other deep learning methods, graph neural networks, anomaly detection and clustering (especially for graphs), attention-based neural networks.  These are pretty specialised and obscure skills to have.  I am pretty sure the language of artificial intelligence is python, which I way down the list of skills in greatest demand.  The job would probably require SQL skills as well as skills in java and java script.

Job titles in demand are the sort of jobs that are similar to fellow in machine learning for cyber security.  Solutions architect net developer and systems engineer have a lot in similarity with my ideal job.  This means that if work as a researcher in machine learning didn’t work out, there would be plenty of similar jobs that would be in demand.
 </li>
<li>
<strong>Adair:  </strong>

My opinion has not been changed by the burning glass data. There is a large requirement for front-end developers, and it was the second most required profession of those within my group. I think this gives me a greater chance of obtaining a job that suits my requirements and skill level.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Geoffrey:  </strong>

By looking at the Burning Glass Data result, my Ideal Job might be the least wanted among others. However, being an entrepreneur is never easy at the beginning, but it will always worth the effort in the end. I’m not changing my Ideal Job because I always dream to be an entrepreneur. It is relaxing when I’m wondering about a company of mine is operating smoothly in the future and I have a steady income because of it.
